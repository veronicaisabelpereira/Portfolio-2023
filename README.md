## Overview

This portfolio was developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Initially, I used a template provided by Bootstrapmade as a starting point and made various modifications across multiple layers to tailor the content and customize the user experience.

## Key Features

- **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap:** Utilized these technologies to build a responsive website.

- **Adaptation of Bootstrapmade Template:** Started with an initial Bootstrap template and made significant adjustments to fully customize the look and feel of the portfolio.
